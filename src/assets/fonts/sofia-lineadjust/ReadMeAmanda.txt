so fonts i paid for weren't vertically aligning and the text appeared differently in mac vs windows--gasp

so i read this stack overflow article https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11726442/font-rendering-line-height-issue-on-mac-pc-outside-of-element

scroll down to the bit about transfonter!  throw font into it and choose 'Fix vertical metrics'

and thank god it helped !!!
