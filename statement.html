     <p class="statement_text">  I position myself in a studio-centered practice. Play, creativity and improvisation is central to making paintings.  I am a &quot;near abstract&quot; painter.  I maintain a loose tie to landscape and still life although most of the images are less referential.</p>

    <p class="statement_text">My paintings aren&rsquo;t rigorously planned but evolve through a process of discovery, intuition and formal scrutiny.  My first idea is usually scrapped and surrendered to the process of painting.  I wipe away a lot of my work and sometimes the wipe becomes the gesture.  I hunt and gather my techniques for a kind of aesthetic extension of the self: the furious motion, the casual mark, the crystallizing bleed, the drip, etc. I want diverse marks, passages, treatments in each canvas. I want each painting to have--like our lives and identities--an inclusive construction.</p>  

    <p class="statement_text">The moderator of the panel on Abstract Painting in the Digital Age said that abstraction happens in chaotic times, as a mode of coping.  Abstraction is also a way of thinking and processing the world. In the fall of 2013, I discovered an interest in text (ie. the &quot;U Series&quot;).  I liked the idea of a word (u, short for you) that could also be an image and a form of decoration.  The &quot;u&quot; seemed more ambiguous than a symbol and took on meaning with repetition.  The marks looked casual, but also separate from one another.  I placed them on a very hard, shiny, iridescent surface (which is not visible in the reproductions) in order to present and resist the flatness of the screen&rsquo;s surface. The marks felt flat but also existed in an illusion of space.  I was thinking space--not because of its visibility on the screen--but felt like an intimacy between texter and phone-space.</p>  

    <p class="statement_text">The process of leaving grad school--having just made my thesis show and the U Series--and moving to New York has altered my work a lot. New York is an intense collision of the virtual and the body.  I see layers everywhere (peeled posters underground and on walls) and I see and feel hierarchies.  Time and space--which is very bounded here--functions within an atmosphere of frenzy and transition.</p>   

    <p class="statement_text">I&rsquo;ve become more contained as a person, not exactly ordered, but more like packed into a container.  One literal example of that development is how I have to pack and re-pack my bag everyday with just enough and nothing more in order to leave the apartment without coming back until the end of the day.  This physical manifestation of containment is happening psychologically, too, as I&rsquo;m simultaneously processing the external and internal changes.  These life developments are slowly being reflected in my work.  (See the series in black and white.  More available on my website.)</p>    

    <p class="statement_text">&quot;Containment&quot; resonates in me psychologically and physically as a mediated space of self and world with literal and metaphorical boundaries.  This is where I am as a painter, exploring the picture plane while thinking and feeling New York...like so many painters before me.</p>
